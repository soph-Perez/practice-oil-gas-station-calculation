# Oil and Gas Station Calculation
Calculates total user cost based on whether or not they are buying oil or gas, how much number of oil cases or gas litres they are purchasing, and what province they are in.

## Requirements:
A gas station wants to write a program which is able to:

Display the following menu:
  - G: Gas
  - O: Oil
  - Allow the user to select one of the above options. The user can type (g or G) and (o or O).
  - If the user selects invalid option (not g/G or o/O), the program should display ‘Invalid input, you should enter g/G or o/O’.
  - Your program should ask the user to enter the following information:
    - Number of oil cases or gas litres
    - Province
  -	Calculate the cost of their oil and gas purchases from their wholesaler, including any discounts and GST. Calculation is based on the following business rules:
  -	Oil must be purchased by the case. There are 12 litres/case. 
  -	Oil costs the station $1.27/ litre before discounts.
  -	If the station purchases more than 8 cases, they receive a 10% discount off the per litre price of the purchase. 
  -	Gasoline is purchased by the litre at a cost of $1.07 per litre. 
  -	If the station purchases more than 4000 litres, they receive a 10% discount off the per litre price.
